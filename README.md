# Loose LaTeX renderer

This is a relatively simple AutoHotkey script and accompanying Eclipse Java project that lets you render LaTeX snippets on-the-fly and insert the generated visuals into almost any app that supports images.

## Prerequisites for building/running
Currently, the script is set up for quick development and iteration. As a result, one must be able to manually compile the Java portion of the app to be able to run it.
- Eclipse or ability to manually compile Java
- Java Runtime Environment
- AutoHotkey

## Building and running with Eclipse
1. Open the Eclipse project that is at the root of the repository
2. Launch the `RenderLatex.ahk` file from Windows Explorer
